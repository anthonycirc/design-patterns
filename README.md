# ⚙️ Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of design patterns implemented in Python.

## 🔨 Creational Patterns

### 🏭 Factory

- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the
  type of objects that will be created. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation
  to subclasses.


### 🏭 Abstract Factory

- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
  without specifying their concrete classes.
