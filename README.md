# ⚙️ Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of design patterns implemented in Python.

## 🔨 Creational Patterns

### 🏭 Factory

- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the
  type of objects that will be created. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation
  to subclasses.

### 🏭 Abstract Factory

- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
  without specifying their concrete classes.

### 🤖 Builder

- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so
  that
  the same construction process can create different representations.

### 🔨 Prototype

- **Intent**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and
  create new objects by copying this prototype.

### 🏗️ Singleton

- **Intent**: Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access
  to it.
