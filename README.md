# ⚙️ Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of design patterns implemented in Python.

## 🔨 Creational Patterns

### 🏭 Factory

- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the
  type of objects that will be created. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation
  to subclasses.

### 🏭 Abstract Factory

- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
  without specifying their concrete classes.

### 🤖 Builder

- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so
  that
  the same construction process can create different representations.

### 🔨 Prototype

- **Intent**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and
  create new objects by copying this prototype.

### 🏗️ Singleton

- **Intent**: Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access
  to it.

## 🔨 Structural Patterns

### 🔌 Adapter

- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
  Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible
  interfaces.

### 🎢 Bridge

- **Intent**: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary
  independently.

### 🎹 Composite

- **Intent**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
  Composite allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects
  uniformly.

### 🪆Decorator

- **Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorator
  provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
